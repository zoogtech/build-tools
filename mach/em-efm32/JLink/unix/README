============
Please make sure that you have installed libusb as this is necessary for 
the J-Link to work via USB.
You can install it the following way for all apt-able Linux derivates:

apt-get -update
apt-get -install libusb

This will update the apt-get package resources and download and install
libusb. Please unplug and replug your J-Link after successful
libusb installation.

You also need to make sure the libreadline is installed on your system.
This library is needed by the JLinkExe utility.

Installing the shared library
=============================
To install the delivered shared library in a system directory perform the following
steps as root:
- Copy the library in a system directory for example /usr/lib 
  cp libjlinkarm.so.* /usr/lib

- Update the cache of dynamic loader and setup symbolic links by running:
  ldconfig

Running JLinkExe with standard user rights
==========================================
In order to run JLinkExe with standard user rights you have to do the following:
